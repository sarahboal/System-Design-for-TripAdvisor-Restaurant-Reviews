# System Design for TripAdvisor Restaurant Reviews
## Final Project Repository for CS 532 at Umass Amherst - Fall 2023


This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze customer sentiments in over 10,000 TripAdvisor restaurant reviews. We developed and compared three sentiment analysis models—two rule-based and one machine learning-based—achieving a 20% improvement in processing time through batch optimization, showcasing efficiency and scalability for business intelligence.
